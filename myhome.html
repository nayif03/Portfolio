                    <h3>History of Syria</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since approximately 10,000 BC, Syria was one of the centers of Neolithic culture (known as
                        Pre-Pottery Neolithic A) where agriculture and cattle breeding appeared for the first time in
                        the world. The following Neolithic period (PPNB) is represented by rectangular houses of
                        Mureybet culture. At the time of the pre-pottery Neolithic, people used vessels made of stone,
                        gyps and burnt lime (Vaisselle blanche). Finds of obsidian tools from Anatolia are evidences of
                        early trade relations. Cities of Hamoukar and Emar played an important role during the late
                        Neolithic and Bronze Age. Archaeologists have demonstrated that civilization in Syria was one
                        of the most ancient on earth, perhaps preceded by only those of Mesopotamia.

                                    the second century AD, and is constructed of black basalt.It is likely that the
                                    theatre was built during the reign of Trajan.

                                    The theatre was originally built outside the walls of the town, but was later
                                    completely enclosed by an Ayyūbid fortress. The city of Bosra had its
                                    fortifications expanded between 481 and 1251. When later integrated into the
                                    fortifications, its role was to serve as a citadel and to guard a road leading to
                                    Damascus.

                                    The theatre is 102 metres across and has seating for about 15,000 people; it is
                                    thus among the largest of the Ancient Roman civilisation.It served a city that once
                                    had 80,000 inhabitants. It is also one of the best preserved both in Syria and
                                    across the Roman empire. It was substantially restored between 1947 and 1970,
                                    before which it contained large quantities of sand, which may have helped to
                                    protect the interior.</p>

                                    Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Hittites. Many buildings were made of stone instead of
                                    clay bricks. The city Ugarit itself is somewhat inland from the coast, where the
                                    seaport (now Minet el-Beida) was constructed. Ugarit also ruled over the city of
                                    Gabala (now Jableh). Ugarit was destroyed in what is known as the Late Bronze Age
                                    collapse. Archaeologists have found a large archive of clay tablets, which have
                                    contributed valuable information on the Late Bronze Age and its dramatic end. The
                                    Ugaritic alphabet was invented and used in Ugarit.</p>
